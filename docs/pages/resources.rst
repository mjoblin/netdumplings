NetDumplings requires `Python 3.5`_ and relies on the fantastic `scapy3k`_ and
`websockets`_ modules.

`scapy3k`_ is a Python 3 fork of `scapy`_.  There's a series of articles called
`Building Network Tools with Scapy`_ which provides a lot of useful
information, including part 4: `Looking at Packets`_.

If you're interested in sniffing your network separate from NetDumplings then
`Wireshark`_ is a good place to start.  There's some great resources on
Wireshark (including video tutorials) at `PacketBomb`_.
